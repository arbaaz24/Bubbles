  Shar files across different platforms by creating Bubbles.
</H3>
<p>
  This tool helps you keep track of files that you have sent or uploaded. Then when needed to reshare those files on another platform, 
  you don't have to go looking for them in separate folders. 
  Just draw a bubble around the ones you already shared(like in slack/ehatsapp/teams/email attachment) and burst the bubble in the destination app.
